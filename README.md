# CVE-2018-4407-IOS

## CVE ? (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

[TLDR](https://movaxbx.ru/2018/10/31/kernel-rce-caused-by-buffer-overflow-in-apples-icmp-packet-handling-code-cve-2018-4407/)

> The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the networking code in the XNU operating
 system kernel. XNU is used by both iOS and macOS, which is why iPhones,
 iPads, and Macbooks are all affected. My exploit PoC just 
overwrites the heap with garbage, which causes an immediate kernel crash
 and device reboot.
